# Jetpack Compose Examples
This simple app contains (for now) an overview on Jetpack Compose tutorial (https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/compose#0) and Kotlin tutorial (https://developer.android.com/courses/kotlin-bootcamp/overview).
<br /><br />
There are also some custom components and animations that I've made using JC, like this pager which tries to explain some Kotlin concepts.

It wants to be a memo for Kotlin and Jetpack Compose basics I've learned from Google tutorials.
